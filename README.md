# Final_Project_DQ

The code of this github page performs a quantum dynamics simulation using the Shin-Metiu model (dynamics of a proton and an electron under the potential created by two fixes ions) and outputs different observables from the simulation. The results include:

- Plot of the BOPES with the second order non-adiabatic couplings (NAC)
- Plot of adiabatic electronic States
- Plot of the potential energy surfaces in the full-space
- mp4 file containing the evolution of the reduced probability densities of proton and electrons, of the adiabatic populations and of the decoherence dynamics coefficients. 

The results aim to reproduce the ones from: Albareda, Guillermo, et al. "Correlated electron-nuclear dynamics with conditional wave functions." Physical review letters 113.8 (2014): 083003.

## Main files
- input.py : input parameters
- main.py : main program 
- Funcs.py : rellevant functions such as normalization or rk4 integrator
- operators.py : important operators such as the laplacian and the soft-core Coulomb interaction term

## Notes
Simulate to 20 fs
